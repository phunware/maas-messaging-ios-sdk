Installation
------------

PWCore is a required dependency for all MaaS modules.

It's recommended that you add PWCore.framework to the 'Vendor/Phunware' directory, then add it to your Xcode project.

The following frameworks are required:

````
SystemConfiguration.framework
MobileCoreServices.framework
QuartzCore.framework
CoreTelephony.framework
Security.framework
````

The following frameworks are optional:

````
CoreLocation.framework
UIKit.framework
````
**NOTE**: CoreLocation is used for comprehensive analytics. Apple mandates that your app have a good reason for enabling location services. Apple will deny your app if location is not a core feature for your app.

After specifying the frameworks, you will need to add a linker flag to your build target. 

Alternatively, you can install PWCore using CocoaPods:

````
// Add this to your Podfile:
pod PWCore
````

To do this:
1. Navigate to your build target.
2. Navigate to the Build Settings tab.
3. Find the Linking Section -> Other Linker Flags.
4. Add "-ObjC" to Other Linker Flags.

You can now install additional MaaS modules.



Application Setup
-----------------
At the top of your application delegate implementation (.m) file, add the following:

````objective-c
#import <PWCore/PWCore.h>
````

Inside your application delegate, you will need to initialize MaaS Core in the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method:

````objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
	// These values can be found for your application in the MaaS portal (http://maas.phunware.com/clients).
    [PWCore setApplicationID:@"APPLICATION_ID"
    			   setAccessKey:@"ACCESS_KEY"
                  signatureKey:@"SIGNATURE_KEY"
                 encryptionKey:@"ENCRYPT_KEY"]; // Currently unused. You can place any NSString value here.
    ...
}
````
